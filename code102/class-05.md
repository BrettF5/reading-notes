## Class-05 Reading Notes:

**CSS** stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  It is a stylesheet language used to enhance the visual control presentation of a html site.  It allows you to add styles (colors, fonts, spacing and positioning) into the html elements. CSS will discribe how these elements in html are diplayed by adding colors, fonts, spacing, visualization and layout.

### What is the purpose of CSS?

The purpose of CSS is to control the visual presentation of web content, providing flexibility, consistency, responsiveness, accessibility, and interactivity, and enabling developers to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites. 



### What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

1. Inline Styles: Will be applied directly within HTML elements
1. Internal Styles: Within the HTML, omterma; styles can be placed within a <style> tag.
`<h1 style='color: green;">Hello World!</h1>`
1. External Styles: Are stored in a sperate file (with a ".css" extension) and is linked within the html file. this is the perfered method.  

### Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text

*Within the '.css' file:*

`
p {
     color: red;
}
`

- 'p' is the sector, which will targets all '<p>' elements within the html file. 'color: red;' is the decclaration. 'color' is the CSS property, and 'red' is the value. 

*** This will then make the website display all the '<p>' elemets in red. ***
