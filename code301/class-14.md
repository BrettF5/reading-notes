### Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1\. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
The rise of the personal computer during the 1980's. Marketing and adverting for personal computer leaned more towards males which leads to the belief that this made it more acceptable for males.  This also with the intrduction of Atrai & Nintends gaming systems.  I grew up during this time period and I do remember those advertisements during that period.  As I do believe this had something to do with decline of women in computer science, I think its not 100% the answer why.   


2\. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
I can answer this from experience.I grew up using the technology. I had a Tandy 1000 when I growing up at that time. I learned how to use the Operation system because I loved playing Flight Simulator.  Also got my first programming experience from it, think it was BASIC.

Becuase it brings in different experiences from different culture backgrounds giving more ways to look at and solve problems.

3\. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
I give you my experience with being in teh Unitied States Air Force.  I have seen how a diverse Air Force can better serve a diverse world.  When the rest of the world see different culture in our Air Force it has made it easier for me to work with people from different countries.
