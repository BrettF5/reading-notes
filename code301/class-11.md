### nosql vs sql:

1\. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL         |  NoSQL          |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------|
| table based               | document based              |
| predefined schema         | dynamic schema              |
| vertically scalable       | horizontally scalable       |
| structured query language | Unstructured Query Language |

*SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries* 

2\. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

SQL is a good fir for complex query intensive enviroments. 

3\. Give a real world example.

One good example would be used in an online retail store and all the information you need to organize about your products, customers and various other things which I do not know at this time.

4\. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

1\. What does SQL stand for?
SQL stands for "Structured Query Language."

2\. What is a relational database?
From GPTChat:
A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure based on the principles of relational algebra. In a relational database, data is organized into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. The relationships between tables are established through keys.

3\. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
tabular structure

4\. What is a ‘schema’?
Schema refers to the structure or blueprint that defines the organization of data within a database.

5\. What is a NoSQL database?

A NoSQL database is a database type that facilitates the storage and retrieval of data using models different from the conventional tabular relationships found in relational databases. NoSQL databases prioritize flexibility and scalability, enabling the handling and processing of extensive amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
