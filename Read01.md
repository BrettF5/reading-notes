## What I learned about Markdown:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows user to format plain text with specific syntax into html. It makes it easy for user to write html files with easy to follow syntax.  It is for generation basic HTML files. It is not a WYSIWG editor. It is used for publishing written content on the web avoiding cumbersome need of use of html. A lot of readme files use Markdown. 

##Some of the basic Markdown basic syntax for Markdown.##
###Headings###
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
** Six hash-tag will create the smallest heading **


## Using Bold and Italic for adding emphasis in Markdown:
If you want to **bold** text, add two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) between the word or phrase you want to emphasis with these options.
You can also Italicsize text or phrases the same way but only uing one *asterisk* or _underscore_.
***For best practice use asterisks (***text***). Underscore has some compatilbility issues with other applications.***

## Creating a Link in Markdown:

To create a link in Markdown you need to added a text description within open and closed brackets. Immediately following the text descrition add the link with parentheses ().
