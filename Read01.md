# Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

## What I learned about Markdown:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows user to format plain text with specific syntax into html. It makes it easy for user to write html files with easy to follow syntax.  It is for generation basic HTML files. It is not a WYSIWG editor. It is used for publishing written content on the web avoiding cumbersome need of use of html. A lot of readme files use Markdown.

###Headings###
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3
** Six hash-tag will create the smallest heading **

When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
Use asterisks (***text***). Underscore has some compatilbility issues with other applications.

How do you create a link with Markdown?
You need to inclose the link text in brackets and the URL followed in parentheses.
EX: My GitHub Reading Notes page is [Brett's Git Hub Reading Notes Homepage](https://brettf5.github.io/reading-notes/)
[Readable Text desscription](Path to file/link)

What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?
- dashes (-)
- asterisks (*)
- plus sign (+)
