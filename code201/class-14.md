In HTML:

</body>
```

In CSS:
```
.rotate-box:hover {
  transform: rotate(45deg); /* Rotate the box by 45 degrees on hover */

In this example, when you hover over the Text, it will rotate 45 degrees.  The `transform` propterty can be used in various other ways such as scaling, skewing and translating.
