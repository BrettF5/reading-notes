\1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- Trust and Respect

- Supportive Leadership

\2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
In the Air Force Reserve I have taken a class a little while back on this. They are starting to lean this dirrection a bit with mility standards. In the Air Force I worked on a few teams that have used these standard and I found that it our memebers high motovation and job satisfaction. Work got done sooner and with better quality. Being able to have open communictaion witht he low ranks and listening and implementing their ideas into the workflow work well. Better than some Sargent just yelling and telling them what to do. In my civillian career field I have not been apart or seen a company I work for do this or take part of these standards.   

\3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
For the company I found increased innovation, higher productivity, better problem-solving, employee retention. For team-members can have increased job satisfaction, boosted confidence, reduced stress, enhanced collaboration and better personal growth.
