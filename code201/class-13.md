### Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites:
\1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
It is so a developer can store data locally on a user's device when they vist their site.  It will allow the web application to remember user preferences, settings or other need data for creating a seamless user experience. 

\2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
Critical data or confidentail data should not be stored locally as it can be accessed by JavaScript.  This cause certain security issues especially if is stored as a cookie file.

\3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
Local storage can only store strings in different keys. One way around this is by using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods. Which yet I have a chance to fully understand. I'll update this once I research further or see if it is explained in tomorrows lecture.
