## HTML Forms:

1. Why are forms so important in web development?
User forms are import for data collection, interactivity  and user experience optimization.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
Keep the form simple and stay focused by only asking for the data you need.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

`<form>` - This element defines the form.
`<label>` - element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
`<input>` - used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user
`<textarea>` - element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control
`<button>` - element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control

## Learn JS:
1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
Events in html are like clicking on a button that will trigger sometype of effent. Like clicking on a light switch.  Theses actions can be diffeerent events like opening 

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
- Event Type (String)
- Event Handler Function (Function)

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
The JavaScript event object holds details about the event, including its type, the specific element involved, mouse positions, keyboard states, and additional data

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
Event Bubbling and Event Capturing are two phases of event propagation in the DOM (Document Object Model)
Evemt Bibbling stats at the the target element.
Event Capturing starts at the root of the DOM tree and will go down to the target element.
