Creating a bootable USB drive for Windows 11 is a straightforward process. You'll need a USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of storage and a Windows 11 ISO file. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

## Method 1: Using the Windows Media Creation Tool (Recommended)
1. **Download Windows 11 ISO:**
First, you need to download the Windows 11 ISO file from the official Microsoft website.

2. **Download Windows Media Creation Tool:**
Go to the Microsoft website and download the **Windows 11 Installation Assistant** or **Media Creation Tool**. This tool simplifies the process of creating a bootable USB drive.

3. **Insert USB Drive:**
Plug in your USB flash drive into an available USB port on your computer.

4. **Run the Media Creation Tool:**
Run the Windows 11 Installation Assistant or Media Creation Tool that you downloaded.

5. **Accept Terms:**
Read and accept the license terms.

6. **Choose Installation Media:**
Select "Create installation media for another PC" and click Next.

7. **Select Language, Edition, and Architecture:**
Choose the language, edition (Windows 11 Home, Pro, etc.), and architecture (32-bit, 64-bit, or both) for the installation. If you're creating the USB drive for the same computer you're using, you can leave the "Use the recommended settings for this PC" option checked.

8. **Select USB Flash Drive:**
Choose "USB flash drive" and click Next.

9. **Select the USB Drive:**
Select your USB flash drive from the list and click Next. Be very careful to choose the correct drive, as all data on the selected drive will be deleted.

10 **Download and Create:**
The tool will download the Windows 11 ISO and create a bootable USB drive. This process may take some time, depending on your internet connection speed.

11. **Completion:**
Once the process is complete, the tool will notify you. You now have a bootable USB drive for Windows 11.

## Method 2: Using Rufus (Advanced Users)
If you prefer more control or the Media Creation Tool doesn't work for some reason, you can use a third-party tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB drive. Here's how:

1. **Download Rufus:**
Download and install Rufus from its official website.

2. **Insert USB Drive:**
Plug in your USB flash drive into an available USB port on your computer.

3. **Run Rufus:**
Run Rufus with administrator privileges.

4. **Configure Rufus:**

- Device: Select your USB drive from the dropdown menu.
- Boot selection: Choose "Disk or ISO image (Please select)".
- Click the "Select" button next to it and browse to the location where your Windows 11 ISO file is saved.
- Partition scheme: Choose between MBR and GPT (usually GPT for modern systems).
- File system: Choose "NTFS".
- Cluster size: Leave it as the default.
- New volume label: You can give a name to your bootable USB (e.g., "Windows 11").

5. **Start the Process:**
Click the "Start" button. Rufus will show a warning that all data on the USB drive will be destroyed. Ensure you've backed up any important data and click OK to proceed.

6. **Wait for Completion:**
Rufus will format the USB drive and copy the Windows 11 installation files. This process may take some time.

7. **Completion:**
Once Rufus shows "READY" at the bottom, the bootable USB drive is created. You can close Rufus and safely eject the USB drive.

*Remember, creating a bootable USB drive will erase all data on the USB drive, so make sure to back up any important files before you proceed.*
