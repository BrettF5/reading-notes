Flexbox is a layout model in CSS.  It alows you to make mix of items or different sizes and returning the best layout for those items.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
Main Axis - You can either make a horizontal (row) or veritcal(column) for the main axis.  The flex items are laid out along this axis.
Cross Axis - It is perpendicular to the main axis.  

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
When using flexbox to reorder the visual display away from the layout in the html document, it can impact accessibilty like for screen readers. Using `row-reverse` or `column-revers` values will change the screen ordering but not how its layed out in the html doc.  This will affect the screen reader will read the logical order that layed out in the html doc.
