---
## Why this topic matters to me:
I'll kind of give my standard message for all these Reading Assigments we been doing. I really want to further and improve my knowledge into being able to design Websites within html, CSS and JS. I wish I more time in the day to absorb this information.  Looking forward to the weekend so I'll have a chance to go back over what we learned this week and absorb it in my brain as if feels full...

## HTML Media:

1. What is a real world use case for the `alt` attribute being used in a website?
If the user is visually impaired and using something like a *screen reader* for them to read the website to them. Also if for some reason the user is using a website that can not display the impage, giving them the alternate text name of the image.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
Giving them a `alt` and `title`. Title will further help add more information about the picture. 

3. Provide an example of when the `figure` element would be useful in an HTML document.
Using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` provides semantic meaning to the relationship between the image and its description, making the HTML document more accessible and understandable.

4. Describe the difference between a `gif` image and an `svg` image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
A `gif` is like a old image flipbook. Where each set on images is flipped quickly giving the images the illusion of movement or animation.  A `svg` 

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
Using *PNG* is likely best because it will no lose image quality. It is called a *lossless format*.

## Learn CSS

1. Describe the difference between `foreground` and `background` colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
Let's say you are in school, back when they used chalkboards. The green background on the chalkboad is the background colors. The white chalk or if you went to a more fance school with color chalk, that would be the  foreground. Foreground is more commonly used for text in html.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
One thing I remeber from reading a while back is *what do want your font to say?*.  

4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

`font-size` - As it basic say's in the name. It changes the font size.  It be changed by `px` size, percentages(`%`) or keywords like small medium large. Or byNote: The standard text size in html is set to 16px at the begning unless changed.
`font-weight` - Will show how bold the text is.
`font-style` Used to turn text to *italic*, *normal* or *oblique*

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
`letter-spacing` . It will alow you to set the spacing inbetween your letters and using `word-spacing` will do the same for words.
Can also use the `margin: 5px` property to set the space around the `<h1>` element.

## ## Things I want to know more about:
A good way to remember to save my md.file before I close out and a-c-p. Done this on yesterday lab assigned and missed out on this sections because I forgot to save.  For this Reading assignment, I would like to learn more about using foreground and background colors to enhance my website.  Along with setting text styles to make it more easier to read.
