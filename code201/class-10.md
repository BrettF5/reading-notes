# Readings: Debugging

---

## What I learned:
- Troubleshooing with JavaScript and the term terminology of debugging.
- Different in syntax errors, logical errors and others.
- Call stack term
- Breakpoint term and how it can help troubleshoot your code.

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
- Sumtax errors are caused incorrectly type codes, misstypes or code written that does not conform to the programming language. These usually give errors that point to the location of the issue or error message stating the issue. 
- Logical errors are when the code syntax is correct but the code does not run as intended by the programer. These can be harder to fix than syntax errors as they do not give an error messeage.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- Syntax error has been my most common. I usually type the wrong character needed for the syntax. Fixing these can usually be easy as I can see what I typed in wrong. Can see this by the error location or message given.
- Reference errors. Where I reference the wrong variables, functions or elements. These can be a bit difficult for me to troubleshoot as I usually have to read the code line by line to find my error.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
Fixing my errors has help me learn html, css and JavaScript. As I fix my errors I learn from them helping become a better programmer.

## The JavaScript Debugger:
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The Web broswer depending which one I use(Chrome, Edge) has a built in inspection tool which I can use to review my code. From inspecting currently-loaded HTML, CSS and JavaScript to showing which assets the page has requested and how long they took to load.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
A breakpoint is a place you can put in your code to prevent it from further execution. By doing this, it can help you identify the issues or errors you are having in you code and pin point the error by preventing other code from running that can complicate troubleshooting.

3. What is the call stack?
It shows you want current line of code was executed on the current line. Can further click on the code in the debber to further see the functions of the code and get further details.

## Things I want to know more about:
I love code review, its been helpfull for my learning process. See other programmers issues, sometimes relating to my issues has help me out greatly.  I like to see how the JavaScript Debugger can help me more out with troubleshooting errors in my code.
