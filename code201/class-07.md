# Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

---

## Domain Modeling:

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
Domain modeling is important because it is an act of designing a blueprint in code that addresses a specific problem or requirement.


## HTML Table Basics:

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
It should not be used for website to lay out the style. HTML tables should only be used for tabular data as this is what they where designed for.

Three reason I found for my notes and reminder:
- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
- Tables produce tag soup
- Tables are not automatically responsive

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.
The content of every table is enclosed by these two tags: <table></table>.
`<td>` - Stands for table data and it is the smallest container inside a table.  They will be placed in alignment with each other. Adding each cell will make it grow longer along the line.
`<th>` - Table headers.  Place it at the start of a row or column and it will spell out the type of data in that row or column.

## Introducing Constructors:

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
It is a way to set the "shape' of an object.  Set it methods and properties it can have. It is a way to use one standard object so you do not need to write out the same code for ever object you create using the same 

2. How does the term `this` differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
`this` in object literals refers to the object the method belongs to, while in constructor functions, it refers to the newly created instance of the object.


## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor:

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
*NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question*
Sorry, I read this but do not fully understand it yet. I'll need to see it more be to better to answer this question. After tomorrow lecture I should understand it better. I'll come back to answer this question. Maybe I'm just tired now to comprehend fully.



## Things I want to know more about:
I would like to know more about Domain Modeling, reading it is one thing being seeing it will help me understand it.  Plus the subject Object Prototypes Using A Constructor.
