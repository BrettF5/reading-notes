        <p>My name is Brett. Here is a litte about me. I'm a US Air Force veteran with 20+ years of service.  I have no college experience as I went straight into the Air Force out of high school. I do have a few computer certifications I learned on my own as listed below.  While in the Air Force I was able to learn a lot about eletronics with the Tech School they sent me too. I was able to use that knowledge to get my first tech job when I got out of active duty wit th Air Force. My first tech job was with a small company managing about 100 IBM servers. this taught me a lot about managing a server lab and I got quite good at it.  This lead me to further jobs in the tehc industry and it further my knowledge. One of my interesting jobs was contrating with Microsoft to test there Windows ME OS on variuous laptops and computers. I written a lot of bug tickets against Windows for the developers during that time. I found out the hated Windows ME wasn't fully its fault. Some of the issues with Windows ME was the vendors didn't want to update there drivers for this new OS from the older Windows versions.</p>
